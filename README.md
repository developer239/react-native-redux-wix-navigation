## Redux React Native Wix Navigation v2 with Auth

### Authorization

All I wanted to show, is how to navigate between public and secured application and how to keep a user logged in.

### Preview

### Data Flow

I only included redux. Most projects will be fine with [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk). If you are more advanced developer, then you probably want to install either [redux-observables](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable) or [redux-sagas](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga). redux-observables are the cool thing to use but working with redux-sagas is much easier.

## Installation

Official installation guide is [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

The rest of the process is straightforward.

1.  Install node_modules: `yarn install`
2.  Link native libraries: `react-native link`

If you have any problems with building your application, please, look at FAQ section of this README or create an issue on GitHub.
